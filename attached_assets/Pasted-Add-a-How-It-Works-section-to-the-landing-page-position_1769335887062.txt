Add a "How It Works" section to the landing page, positioned AFTER the hero section and BEFORE the pricing section.

## Design Requirements:

### Layout
- Full-width section with dark background (matching existing design)
- Centered heading: "How It Works" (large, gradient text)
- Subtitle: "Track your Polymarket bets with real-world data in 3 simple steps"
- 3 steps displayed horizontally on desktop, stacked on mobile

### Step Cards (3 cards)

**Step 1: Add Your Bets**
- Icon: Plus icon or clipboard icon
- Number badge: "1" (large, in circle)
- Title: "Add Your Bets"
- Description: "Enter your Polymarket positions manually or connect your wallet. We automatically detect the bet type (crypto, weather, stocks, sports)."
- Visual: Simple illustration or icon

**Step 2: We Track Real-World Data**
- Icon: Activity/chart icon or radar icon
- Number badge: "2"
- Title: "We Track Real-World Events"
- Description: "Our system monitors live prices, weather conditions, sports scores, and stock movements from reliable APIs. Updates every 60 seconds."
- Visual: Simple illustration or icon

**Step 3: Get Instant Insights**
- Icon: Bell or alert icon
- Number badge: "3"
- Title: "Get Instant Insights"
- Description: "See win/loss status, distance to threshold, and P&L in real-time. Get alerts when conditions change or you're close to winning."
- Visual: Simple illustration or icon

### Styling

**Each card should have:**
- Glassmorphism effect (semi-transparent background with blur)
- Border with subtle glow
- Padding: generous (p-8)
- Hover effect: slight lift and increased glow
- Icon at top (60x60px, colored purple/blue gradient)
- Number badge (large circle, top-right or top-left corner)
- Title (text-xl, bold, white)
- Description (text-gray-400, leading relaxed)

**Overall section:**
- Background: Dark gradient (slate-900 to purple-900/20)
- Padding: py-20 (desktop), py-12 (mobile)
- Max width: container (max-w-7xl)

### Optional: Visual Flow

Add arrows between cards on desktop (→ arrows) showing the flow:
```
[Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3]
```

### Code Structure:
```jsx
<section className="py-20 bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-purple-900/20">
  <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6">
    {/* Heading */}
    <div className="text-center mb-16">
      <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-400 bg-clip-text text-transparent">
        How It Works
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-400 text-lg">
        Track your Polymarket bets with real-world data in 3 simple steps
      </p>
    </div>

    {/* Steps */}
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
      {/* Step 1 Card */}
      {/* Step 2 Card */}
      {/* Step 3 Card */}
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Icons to use:
- Use Lucide React icons (already in project)
- Step 1: `Plus`, `ClipboardList`, or `Edit`
- Step 2: `Activity`, `TrendingUp`, or `BarChart3`
- Step 3: `Bell`, `CheckCircle`, or `Zap`

### Responsive Design:
- Desktop (md and up): 3 columns, horizontal layout
- Tablet (sm to md): 2 columns, then 1 on last row
- Mobile (below sm): Single column, stacked vertically
- Arrows only visible on desktop (hidden on mobile)

### Animation (optional but nice):
- Fade in cards on scroll (stagger effect)
- Cards appear one by one with slight delay
- Use simple CSS transitions or Framer Motion if available

### Position in page:
Place this section:
1. After hero/header section
2. Before pricing section
3. Before FAQ section

The section should naturally flow with existing design and feel cohesive with the dark theme, purple/blue gradients, and glassmorphism style used throughout the landing page.

Keep it simple, clean, and easy to understand. Users should immediately grasp the value proposition.
